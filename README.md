A landing page is a single web page designed for a specific campaign to achieve a distinct goal. It’s where a user lands when they click on an online ad, button, or link— hence, the name “landing page.” 

A landing page has a pre-defined purpose and is designed to guide visitors to take a particular action. This is precisely why landing pages are so effective in driving conversion — they focus on one specific target that’s clear, well-explained, and achievable.
Designing a landing page can often feel like a tricky mix of art and science. You want the page to represent the brand in both graphics and text, while also moving visitors farther along the sales funnel. It can be a tricky balance to strike.
